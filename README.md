# Graphs
This project covers:

A)  Three ways to construct a graph:
    1.  Vertices and edges 
    2.  Adjacency lists
    3.  Adjacency matrix
  
B)  Construction of weighted and unweighted graphs for vertices and edges representation
  
C)  Implementation of BFS for all representations

D)  Implementation of DFS for Vertices and edges representation and adjacency list representation

E)  Implementaion of the following shortest path algorithms for the Vertices and edges representation
    1.  Dijkstra's Algorithm
    2.  Bellman ford
    3.  Best first search
    4.  A* search
